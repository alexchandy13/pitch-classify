# pitch-classify

Attempting to predict the result of a baseball pitch can be extremely beneficial to baseball pitchers from a strategic standpoint. Given the data at our hands nowadays, classification algorithms can be tuned to a batter's specific tendencies, and allow pitchers to predict what will happen if they throw a certain pitch. In this paper, 3 different classification algorithms were explored and evaluated: K-Nearest Neighbors, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression. PCA was used to reduce dimensionality, and storage space, for future applications of this project. Initial results were respectable, with ~75% accuracy from the K-Nearest Neighbors and Naive Bayes algorithm, and after PCA, there was very little accuracy loss. Although Logistic Regression performed poorly initially, when the RBF kernel trick was applied, there was an accuracy boost that allowed it to reach the ~75% mark set by the other two algorithms. This sets up possible avenues for further research on this topic, as different kernels could be experimented with.
